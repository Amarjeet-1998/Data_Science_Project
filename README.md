Fundamental analysis (you can read more about it here):

Evaluates a company’s stock by examining its intrinsic value, including but not limited to tangible assets, financial statements, management effectiveness, strategic initiatives, and consumer behaviors; essentially all the basics of a company.

Being a relevant indicator for long-term investment, the fundamental analysis relies on both historical and present data to measure revenues, assets, costs, liabilities, and so on.

Generally speaking, the results from fundamental analysis don’t change with short-term news. 



Technical analysis (you can read more about it here):

Analyzes measurable data from stock market activities, such as stock prices, historical returns, and volume of historical trades; i.e. quantitative information that could identify trading signals and capture the movement patterns of the stock market.

Technical analysis focuses on historical data and current data just like fundamental analysis, but it’s mainly used for short-term trading purposes.

Due to its short-term nature, technical analysis results are easily influenced by news.

Popular technical analysis methodologies include moving average (MA), support and resistance levels, as well as trend lines and channels.
